    Iroh Yarjiret the Chaotic Sentinel is a dragonborn fighter from the West. Next in line to be the king of his clan, Iroh fights to prove his worthiness to his father that he is ready to be a leader. He acts as a double agent by worshipping the gods Bahumut and Tiamat, who are both siblings and sworn enemies. While he struggles with internal battle between good and evil, his own moral code always wins out in the end.
