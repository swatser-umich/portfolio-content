    <!--Storm Giant Hold. Our mission was to find the storm giant hold that is rumored to exist underwater beneath a set of islands. Our team used a Breathe Underwater spell to swim down to the Storm Giant hold. We came across assassins, cult spellcasters, and a powerful barbarian leader. While fighting against these enemies, a giant Kraken is hitting itself on the dome above the Storm Giant hold to try and enter. Trusting the intentions of this leviathan, we encouraged our cloud giant ally Zephras to sit on the Storm Giant throne and allow the kraken to enter the dome. The kraken and our group were able to defeat the group of enemies, and we gained a powerful ally along the way. -->
    
    <!--Gwayrune Slumber Battle. Fate called our team into the forest of Gwayrune Slumber. We ran into a golden hunter trying to capture a dextrous deer in the forest, who eventually transformed into two onis, likened to demons. Our team struggled to fight against these powerful enemies, as one oni regenerated health as we damaged it. Lil Wyvern was targeted as the first target and was struck down unconscious before Crofoot used Dimension Door to carry him far away from the battle. Silas's father came to help in our struggle, but was ultimately struck down, crushed to pieces by the oni. From here, our team was able to subdue the regenerating oni. The other oni, who was floating overhead, flew away to flee the scene. Once our team was able to recover and revive ourselves, we hunted down this flying oni and took her out. -->
    
    <!--Ritual to Change Gods. Morally unable to continue the bidding of her dark goddess, Kathra collected the ritual ingredients to switch from her current chaotic evil goddess Beshaba to the lawful good goddess Berronar Truesilver. Her team followed her into the realm of Beshaba, where they had to fight chimeras, falling debris, and the goddess Beshaba herself. With the help of Kathra's new goddess Truesilver, the team was able to escape this realm into the Astral realm, successfully completing the ritual. -->
