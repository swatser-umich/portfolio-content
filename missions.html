                    <figcaption><bold>Hydra in Blythe. </bold>While in Blythe, our team discovered a horde of giant crabs running from the ocean onto land. 
                        With a few moments of investigation, we realized that these crabs were running away from a hydra, which immediately came onto shore and attacked the city. 
                        Our team utilized a spread routine where we pulled the monster into different directions, as it kept growing heads the more it got injured. 
                        Recognizing that fire is its weakness, Crofoot attacked consistently with fireball until the monster was down.</figcaption>

                        Upon arrival, we came across assassins, cult spellcasters, and a powerful barbarian leader. 
                        Through an allyship with a kraken, our group was able to defeat the group of enemies, and we gained a powerful ally along the way.</figcaption>

                    From here, we defended the castle against a powerful sorceress. This sorceress brought with her a legion of multi-colored dragons to attack the city.

        <!--Ritual to Change Gods. Morally unable to continue the bidding of her dark goddess, Kathra collected the ritual ingredients to switch from her current chaotic evil goddess Beshaba to the lawful good goddess Berronar Truesilver. Her team followed her into the realm of Beshaba, where they had to fight chimeras, falling debris, and the goddess Beshaba herself. With the help of Kathra's new goddess Truesilver, the team was able to escape this realm into the Astral realm, successfully completing the ritual. -->
