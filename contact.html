    If you'd like to contact us, we have many ways that you can try, based on the urgency of the situation. 
    Minor (services needed within the year) - Write a letter to one of our hometowns or come find one of us in one of our hometowns that is closest to you. If you ask around, you will be sure to find us or know where we are headed. 
        Crofoot - Blythe
        Iroh - Yarjiret
        Kathra - Mintarn 
        Lil Wyvern - Gnomandy
        Silas - Waterdeep 
    Major (services needed within the month) - Come find us in one of our main cities and contact one of our allies to find us. 
        Phandalin - Daron Edermath, Toblin
        Neverwinter - Lord Neverember, Anvuthar, Vice Admiral Sabine
    Critical (services needed within the week) - Use a Sending spell to contact one of us, and we can come to you by the end of the week. Please note that you can only use this option if you have ever contacted us before. If you cannot cast spells, you can purchase a Sending spell scroll for about 800 gold pieces.
